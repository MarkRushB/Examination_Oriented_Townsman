## Why Coinbase

Our company's main business is crypto currency, which is very popular in recent years, -> digital age

The company is developing rapidly and has great potential. I believe it is a good opportunity for me，Because I have just graduated, full of energy and hope to learn a lot

## What can you bring for our company

1: for the work, for the Tech skills, I know I am just a new grad, so compared with my colleagus, I am the most inexperienced guy, It is hard to say that I could bring some advanced tech for the company, but I think my advantage is I have strong ability to learn and i am a fast learner, so basically I am curious about new knowledges, and acts to explore them! so if I was in, I could adapt the productive env rapidly and contribute my own power, help my collegues, imporve the efficiency of the whole project!
2: for the Diversity, I come from China, and for my self, always seek to improve myself, and I am open to others critical feedback. I really enjoy cooking!


## Self Introduction
My name is Sichen Zhao, I am pursuing an Information System major at Northeastern University. I am expected to graduate in December this year.

I worked as a software engineer intern in Cmind-Ai this Spring, which is a fin-tech start-up company. and my job there includes developing** new features like trending news and stock portfolio via React, MongoDB

可说可不说（he once optimized the** backend algorithms via ElasticSearch for high-efficiency search on GBs data and increased the search speed by 60%.）



For the study, I took some courses like *Data Structure & Algorithms, Web Design & User Experience, Web Development Tools, Application Engineering & Development, Data Science Engineering Methods & Tools.*

I never stop learning and always seek to improve myself, I am curious about new possibilities and acts to explore them. 

My undergraduate major is Management Information System, so there were some courses related to computer programming and data analysis. The undergraduate study career has inspired my interest in programming, which is why I came to NEU to continue learning programming..

## Java
### Java’s Feature
1. Simple
2. Object-Oriented
3. Portable
4. Platform independent: write once, run anywhere
5. Secured
6. Robust
7. Architecture neutral
8. Interpreted
9. High Performance
10. Multithreaded
11. Distributed
12. Dynamic

### OOP 3 features
#### Encapsulation
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

- declare class variables/attributes as private
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
#### Inheritance
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

- subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

Polymorphism in Java can be performed by two different methods:

- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding

Overlading vs. Overriding
- Overloading is a term used to describe when two methods have the same name but different in the type or number of arguments
- Overriding occurs when a method shares the same name and function signature as another method in its super class

Overwritting: 
Car Class, not overwrite ->  com.stu.Car@2542880d class name + @ + hashCode
overwrite -> 
```java
public String toString(){
        return "这个汽车名叫 "+carName+",型号是 "+carNo+",汽车颜色 "+color+",价格 "+price;
    }
```


### Java Keywords
#### access modifier
**public:** Used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class
**private:**	Used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class
**protected:**	Used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses

#### non-access modifier
**static:**	Used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class
**final:** Used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)
**abstract:** Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
**synchronized:**	which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time

### System.out.println()

**System.out.println()** is used to print an argument that is passed to it. The statement can be broken into 3 parts which can be understood separately as:

1. **System:** It is a final class defined in the java.lang package. ![](https://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/739525/201601/739525-20160119185727687-1621310018.png)
2. **out:** This is an instance of **PrintStream** type, which is a public and static member field of the System class. ![](https://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/739525/201601/739525-20160119190442328-550264769.png)
3. **println():** As all instances of **PrintStream class** have a public method println(), hence we can invoke the same on out as well. This is an upgraded version of print(). It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output. We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream. ![](https://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/739525/201601/739525-20160119191040250-1798193938.png)


### Lambda
```java
Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(s), new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
        return o1.length()-o2.length();
    }
});
```
```java
Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(s), (p,q)->{
    return p.length()-q.length();
});
```


### JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
![](https://www.guru99.com/images/1/2.png)
#### Class Loader
The class loader is a subsystem used for loading class files. It performs three major functions viz. Loading, Linking, and Initialization.
#### Method Area
Method Area is a part of the heap memory which is shared among all the threads. It creates when the JVM starts up. It is used to store class structure, superclass name, interface name, and constructors. The JVM stores the following kinds of information in the method area:

1. A Fully qualified name of a type (ex: String)
2. The type's modifiers
3. Type's direct superclass name
4. A structured list of the fully qualified names of super interfaces.

#### Heap Area

**Heap stores the actual objects. It creates when the JVM starts up.** The user can control the heap if needed. It can be of fixed or dynamic size. **When you use a new keyword, the JVM creates an instance for the object in a heap. While the reference of that object stores in the stack. There exists only one heap for each running JVM process.** When heap becomes full, the garbage is collected. For example:

`StringBuilder sb= new StringBuilder();`

The above statement creates an object of the StringBuilder class. The object allocates to the heap, and the reference sb allocates to stack. 

Heap is divided into the following parts:

![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20150908155026054)

* Young generation
* Survivor space
* Old generation
* Permanent generation
* Code Cache

大部分情况，对象都会首先在 Eden 区域分配，在一次新生代垃圾回收后，如果对象还存活，则会进入 s0 或者 s1，并且对象的年龄还会加 1(Eden区i>Survivor 区后对象的初始年龄变为1)，当它的年龄增加到一定程度(默认为15岁)，就会被晋升到老年代中。对象晋升到老年代的年龄阈值，可以通过参数 `-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold` 来设置。另外，大对象和⻓期存活的对象会直接进入老年代。

年轻代（Young Generation）

对象在被创建时，内存首先是在年轻代进行分配（注意，大对象可以直接在老年代分配）。当年轻代需要回收时会触发Minor GC(也称作Young GC)。

年轻代由Eden Space和两块相同大小的Survivor Space（又称S0和S1）构成，可通过-Xmn参数来调整新生代大小，也可通过-XX:SurvivorRadio来调整Eden Space和Survivor Space大小。不同的GC方式会按不同的方式来按此值划分Eden Space和Survivor Space，有些GC方式还会根据运行状况来动态调整Eden、S0、S1的大小。

年轻代的Eden区内存是连续的，所以其分配会非常快；同样Eden区的回收也非常快（因为大部分情况下Eden区对象存活时间非常短，而Eden区采用的复制回收算法，此算法在存活对象比例很少的情况下非常高效，后面会详细介绍）。

如果在执行垃圾回收之后，仍没有足够的内存分配，也不能再扩展，将会抛出OutOfMemoryError:Java Heap Space异常。

老年代（Old Generation）

老年代用于存放在年轻代中经多次垃圾回收仍然存活的对象，可以理解为比较老一点的对象，例如缓存对象；新建的对象也有可能在老年代上直接分配内存，这主要有两种情况：一种为大对象，可以通过启动参数设置-XX:PretenureSizeThreshold=1024，表示超过多大时就不在年轻代分配，而是直接在老年代分配。此参数在年轻代采用Parallel Scavenge GC时无效，因为其会根据运行情况自己决定什么对象直接在老年代上分配内存；另一种为大的数组对象，且数组对象中无引用外部对象。

当老年代满了的时候就需要对老年代进行垃圾回收，老年代的垃圾回收称作Major GC（也称作Full GC）。

老年代所占用的内存大小为-Xmx对应的值减去-Xmn对应的值。

#### JVM Language Stack
**Stack memory is responsible for holding references to heap objects and for storing value types (also known in Java as primitive types), which hold the value itself rather than a reference to an object from the heap.**

The stack is a part of memory that contains information about nested method calls down to the current position in the program. It also contains all local variables and references to objects on the heap defined in currently executing methods.

This structure allows the runtime to return from the method knowing the address whence it was called, and also clear all local variables after exiting the method. Every thread has its own stack.


#### Native Method Stack

It is also known as C stack. **It is a stack for native code written in a language other than Java.** Java Native Interface (JNI) calls the native stack. The performance of the native stack depends on the OS.

#### PC Registers

**Each thread has a Program Counter (PC) register associated with it. PC register stores the return address or a native pointer. It also contains the address of the JVM instructions currently being executed.**
程序计数器是一个比较小的内存区域，可能是CPU寄存器或者操作系统内存，其主要用于指示当前线程所执行的字节码执行到了第几行，可以理解为是当前线程的行号指示器。字节码解释器在工作时，会通过改变这个计数器的值来取下一条语句指令。 每个程序计数器只用来记录一个线程的行号，所以它是线程私有（一个线程就有一个程序计数器）的。

如果程序执行的是一个Java方法，则计数器记录的是正在执行的虚拟机字节码指令地址；如果正在执行的是一个本地（native，由C语言编写完成）方法，则计数器的值为Undefined，由于程序计数器只是记录当前指令地址，所以不存在内存溢出的情况，因此，程序计数器也是所有JVM内存区域中唯一一个没有定义OutOfMemoryError的区域。

### Working of Garbage Collector

#### Garbage Collector Overview

When a program executes in Java, it uses memory in different ways. The heap is a part of memory where objects live. It's the only part of memory that involved in the garbage collection process. It is also known as garbage collectible heap. All the garbage collection makes sure that the heap has as much free space as possible. The function of the garbage collector is to find and delete the objects that cannot be reached.

#### GC机制

##### JVM Heap memory (Hotspot heap structure)  in java consists of following elements
- Young Generation
  - Eden
  - S0 (Survivor space 0)
  - S1 (Survivor space 1)
- Old Generation (Tenured)
- Permanent Generation.

##### Young Generation (Minor garbage collection occurs in Young Generation)

- New objects are allocated in Young generation.
- Minor garbage collection occurs in Young Generation.
- When the young generation fills up, this causes a minor garbage collection. All the unreferenced (dead) objects are cleaned up from young generation.

##### Old Generation (tenured generation) - (Major garbage collection occurs in Old Generation)
  
- The Old Generation is used for storing the long surviving aged objects.
- Major garbage collection occurs in Old Generation.
- When the old generation fills up, this causes a major garbage collection. Objects are cleaned up from old generation.

##### Permanent Generation or (Permgen) - (full garbage collection occurs in permanent generation in java).

- Permanent generation Space contains metadata required by JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application.
- The permanent generation is included in a full garbage collection in java.

#### Types of Garbage Collection

There are five types of garbage collection are as follows:

* **Serial GC:** It uses the mark and sweeps approach for young and old generations, which is minor and major GC.
* **Parallel GC:** It is similar to serial GC except that, it spawns N (the number of CPU cores in the system) threads for young generation garbage collection.
* **Parallel Old GC:** It is similar to parallel GC, except that it uses multiple threads for both generations.
* **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector:** **It does the garbage collection for the old generation. You can limit the number of threads in CMS collector using** **XX:ParalleCMSThreads=JVM option** . It is also known as Concurrent Low Pause Collector.
* **G1 Garbage Collector:** It introduced in Java 7. Its objective is to replace the CMS collector. It is a parallel, concurrent, and CMS collector. There is no young and old generation space. It divides the heap into several equal sized heaps. It first collects the regions with lesser live data.

#### Mark and Sweep Algorithm

JRockit JVM uses the mark, and sweep algorithm for performing the garbage collection. It contains two phases, the mark phase, and the sweep phase.

**Mark Phase:** Objects that are accessible from the threads, native handles, and other GC root sources are marked as live. Every object tree has more than one root objects. GC root is always reachable. So any object that has a garbage collection root at its root. It identifies and marks all objects that are in use, and the remaining can be considered garbage.

![Memory Management in Java](https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/memory-management-in-java2.png)

**Sweep Phase:** In this phase, the heap is traversed to find the gap between the live objects. These gaps are recorded in the free list and are available for new object allocation.

There are two improved versions of mark and sweep:

* **Concurrent Mark and Sweep**
* **Parallel Mark and Sweep**

##### Concurrent Mark and Sweep

It allows the threads to continue running during a large portion of the garbage collection. There are following types of marking:

* **Initial marking:** It identifies the root set of live objects. It is done while threads are paused.
* **Concurrent marking:** In this marking, the reference from the root set are followed. It finds and marks the rest of the live objects in a heap. It is done while the thread is running.
* **Pre-cleaning marking:** It identifies the changes made by concurrent marking. Other live objects marked and found. It is done while the threads are running.
* **Final marking:** It identifies the changes made by pre-cleaning marking. Other live objects marked and found. It is done while threads are paused.

##### Parallel Mark and Sweep

It uses all available CPU in the system for performing the garbage collection as fast as possible. It is also called the parallel garbage collector. Threads do not execute when the parallel garbage collection executes.

**Pros of Mark and Sweep**

* It is a recurring process.
* It is an infinite loop.
* No additional overheads allowed during the execution of an algorithm.

**Cons of Mark and Sweep**

* It stops the normal program execution while the garbage collection algorithm runs.
* It runs multiple times on a program.

### Java Collection Time Complexity

#### List

##### ArrayList

get() 直接读取下标，复杂度 O(1)
add(E) 直接在队尾添加，复杂度 O(1)
add(index, E) 在第n个元素后插入，n后面的元素需要向后移动，复杂度 O(n)
remove() 删除元素后面的元素需要逐个前移，复杂度 O(n)

##### LinkedList

addFirst() 添加队列头部，复杂度 O(1)
removeFirst() 删除队列头部，复杂度 O(1)
addLast() 添加队列尾部，复杂度 O(1)
removeLast() 删除队列尾部，复杂度 O(1)
getFirst() 获取队列头部，复杂度 O(1)
getLast() 获取队列尾部，复杂度 O(1)
get() 获取第n个元素，依次遍历，复杂度O(n)
add(E) 添加到队列尾部，复杂度O(1)
add(index, E) 添加到第n个元素后，需要先查找到第n个元素，复杂度O(n)
remove() 删除元素，修改前后元素节点指针，复杂度O(1)

#### Set

##### HashSet

add() 复杂度为 O(1)
remove() 复杂度为 O(1)
contains() 复杂度为 O(1)

##### TreeSet（基于红黑树）

add() 复杂度为 O(log (n))
remove() 复杂度为 O(log (n))
contains() 复杂度为 O(log (n))

#### map

##### TreeMap（基于红黑树）

平均时间复杂度 O(log n)

##### HashMap

正常时间复杂度 O(1)~O(n)
红黑树后 O(log n)

##### LinkedHashMap

能以时间复杂度 O(1) 查找元素，又能够保证key的有序性

### HashMap, HashTable, HashSet

#### 说说 List,Set,Map 三者的区别?

- List (对付顺序的好帮手): 存储的元素是有序的、可重复的。
- Set (注重独一无二的性质): 存储的元素是无序的、不可重复的。
- Map (用 Key 来搜索的专家): 使用键值对(kye-value)存储，类似于数学上的函数 y=f(x)，“x”代表 key，"y"代表 value，Key 是无序的、不可重复的，value 是无序的、可重复的，每个键最多映射到一个值。

#### HashMap 详解

- inherits(implement) from Map interface
- **equals()**: It checks the equality of two objects. It compares the Key, whether they are equal or not. It is a method of the Object class. It can be overridden. If you override the equals() method, then it is mandatory to override the hashCode() method.
- **hashCode()**: This is the method of the object class. It returns the memory reference of the object in integer form. The value received from the method is used as the bucket number. The bucket number is the address of the element inside the map. Hash code of null Key is 0.
- **Buckets**: Array of the node is called buckets. Each node has a data structure like a LinkedList. More than one node can share the same bucket. It may be different in capacity.
- 底层：
  - JDK1.8之前：数组 + 链表
  - JDK1.8之后：数组 + 链表 + 红黑树，链表长度 > 8时转化为红黑树
  - **Hash Collision**
    - This is the case when the calculated index value is the same for two or more Keys. Let's calculate the hash code for another Key "Sunny." Suppose the hash code for "Sunny" is 63281940. To store the Key in the memory, we have to calculate index by using the index formula.
    - `Index=63281940 & (16-1) = 4`
    - ![](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/core/working-of-hashmap-in-java4.png)
    - The value 4 is the computed index value where the Key will be stored in HashMap. In this case, equals() method check that both Keys are equal or not. If Keys are same, replace the value with the current value. Otherwise, connect this node object to the existing node object through the LinkedList. Hence both Keys will be stored at index 4.
- 初始化默认大小16，必须是2的整数次幂(the integer power of 2)
- 最大容量:必须是2的整数次幂且小于2^30
- load factor 负载因子 默认 0.75 当元素数量大于capacity * load factor的时候，扩容 -> *2

#### HashMap vs HashTable

##### Thread Safe

HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code whereas Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.

HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed

##### key -> Value

HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value -> `NullPointerException`.

##### 初始容量大小和扩容

创建时如果不指定容量初始值，Hashtable 默认的初始大小为 11，之后每次扩充，容量变为原来的 2n+1。

HashMap 默认的初始化大小为 16。之后每次扩充，容量变为原来的 2 倍。

创建时如果给定了容量初始值，那么 Hashtable 会直接使用你给定的大小，而 HashMap 会将其扩充为 2 的幂次方大小(HashMap 中的 tableSizeFor() 方法保证，下面给出了源代码)。也就是说 HashMap 总是使用 2 的幂作为哈希表的大小,后面会介绍到为什么是 2 的幂次方。

##### 底层数据结构

HashMap : JDK1.8 之前 HashMap 由数组+链表组成的，数组是 HashMap 的主体，链表则是主要为了解决哈希冲突而存在的(“拉链法”解决冲突)。JDK1.8 以后在解决哈希冲突时有了较大的变化，当链表⻓度大于阈值(默认为 8)(将链表转换成红黑树前会判断，如果当前数组的⻓度小于64，那么会选择先进行数组扩容，而不是转换为红黑树)时，将链表转化为红黑树，以减少搜索时间

#### Hashmap vs HashSet

如果你看过 HashSet 源码的话就应该知道:HashSet 底层就是基于 HashMap 实现的。(HashSet 的源码非常非常少，因为除了 clone() 、 writeObject() 、 readObject() 是 HashSet 自己不得不实现之外，其他方法都是直接调用 HashMap 中的方法。

HashSet is an implementation of Set Interface which does not allow duplicate value.

HashMap internally uses a hashing method to store the elements. On the other hand, the HashSet uses the HashMap object to store or add the elements.

#### HashSet如何检查重复

compute the object's hashcode -> determine where to add / compare with other's hashcode

- if not -> add
- if duplicate -> 这时会调用 equals() 方法来检查 hashcode 相等的对象是否真的相同 -> false


### Spring
#### IOC
Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control. 

There are two types of IoC containers. They are:

- BeanFactory
- ApplicationContext

#### AOP

**Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)** compliments OOPs in the sense that it also provides modularity. But the key unit of modularity is aspect than class.

AOP breaks the program logic into distinct parts (called concerns). It is used to increase modularity by **cross-cutting concerns**.

A **cross-cutting concern** is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible, such as transaction management, authentication, logging, security etc.

## Database
### Normal form
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics

#### 1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
- Each table cell should contain a single value.
- Each record needs to be unique.

#### 2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules
- Rule 1- Be in 1NF
- Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation

#### 3NF (Third Normal Form) Rules
- Rule 1- Be in 2NF
- Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies

This returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises. It rejects immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting or non-promises throwing an error, and will reject with this first rejection message / error. **This method can be useful for aggregating the results of multiple promises.

Github Action: CI/CD or CICD is the combined practices of [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) and either [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) or [continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) (CD).
   1. **What is CI?**: Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.
   1. **What is CD?:** Following the automation of builds and unit and integration testing in CI, continuous delivery automates the release of that validated code to a repository.

### Automated data analytics report process:
It is just implemented with Python, Cuz some of my colleagues don't have the foundation of coding, so for the data report and visualization, they just generated the chart by inputting the data into Excel manually, that definitely consumed too much time, So I just configure the Python for them, and import Numpy, pandas, and other chart libraries to write a script, all the things they need to do is just import the raw data files, and the code will automatic clean and filter and sort those data and generate chart for them.

What is Creativity?

Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity is characterised by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing.

What continuous drive you work at Ironclad?

What is your team culture like?



## Company Research
### IronClad:

Ironclad is the leading digital contracting platform for legal teams. Business contracts for the digital age. I like the slogan.

` `It is digital contracting, it is a new standard, and it is changing the way that company manage its contract life cycle, welcome to the digital age

I think now is a digital age, digital technology is changing our lives, I like the ironclad model very much. I also think it is thanks to the digital age. Decades ago, it was difficult to imagine the combination of digitalization and legal affairs. Law is a traditional industry with a long history. BTW, my father is a lawyer, and he also works for some companies as the legal advisor. I still remember that there was a big bookcase in my home, and it was full of my dad’s files. All my impressions were that my dad was going through the documents for the whole  day. It is just a little story about me. Back to the topic, I just think the digital age definitely has a great power to influence our life, it could change the manual process into automatic workflows, that’s the charm of Improving the efficiency of the company's contract process, I was thinking, if there was an app like ironclad at that time, would my dad have more time to accompany me?I think ironclad has the huge potential, and that is also why I want to join ironclad and contribute myself.

### IntelyCare:
I noticed that there is a big slogan displayed on your website: **A Smarter Healthcare Staffing & Scheduling Solution.** 


I think now is a digital age, digital technology is changing our lives, I like the IntelyCare model very much. I also think it is thanks to the digital age. HealthCare is a traditional industry with a long history. Decades ago, it was difficult to imagine the combination of digitalization and HealthCare affairs. 

- simplifies the staffing and scheduling process to match qualified [Nursing Professionals](https://www.intelycare.com/for-nursing-professionals/)
- [Schedulers and Administrators](https://www.intelycare.com/for-nursing-facilities/) can focus on patient care without having to worry about paperwork and reporting headaches.

Digital age definitely has a great power to influence our life, it could change the manual process into automatic workflows,

**You Change Lives. We Want to Change Yours.** 

We believe that the work that you do every day changes people’s lives.

By re-imagining the way you work, we can change your life for the better, too.

And after all that you’ve done for others, it’s the least we can do for you.

That is the ultimate goal, and what I want to see as a software engineer, is to use the power of technology to improve people's lives.




## Stock market forecasting multi-processing
That would be my stock market forecasting system. In order to train our model, we definitely need a large volume of data. **So we grab nearly 30 years of news data from New York times API**, considering the volume is huge, and we can get pretty much information just From the news headline, we choose to use this 30 years of news headline to be our data source and it's nearly one gigabyte of pure text data, which is a lot.

We need to clean and process data, to get accepted by model, while the model provides some parallel/multicore process, **the speed of processing raw data is slow.**

After doing some research, I actually found a way to multi core process the data processing port, but since the Jupyter notebook is an interactive interpreter, some function in the python package: multiprocessing.pool will not return our desired result.

We almost gave up the thought of multi-processing this part, because it works, but it's just very slow. I came up with a creative solution after deep diving into the solutions. I put the paralleled code outside of the Jupyter notebook, as a Seperate.py file, I pass the data art call that file in the notebook, it runs Outside of Juse notebook, then read and import the result back. **it works and it's almost 7 times faster than the old method.**

## Miss deadline_Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline 
When I was developing a new feature in my latest internship, We have a new feature that was pretty easy to implement, that's a add-on on previous built function, which is retrieve the news data from DB and display on the frontend page,  my manager ask me to estimate how long can it be done, since we already have a Working structure, just need to follow the previous code structure and do some changes, I said I can get it done by today. 

I got the feature done within the expected timeline, but when I'm doing the testing, **I found the frontend page will crash while testing some case, then I look through code and data further,  I found that the reason why crash is the some old news data stored in our DB are not validated and unified.** So the backend API I just implemented didn’t fully sanitize those old news data and just passed them to the frontend, So when it's trying to parse the unmatched data to the front function, the frontend will throw an error and stop running. 

Since the sanitize rules is a part of our previously built function, that means all of the add-on APIs in that function may have the same problem. While in the frontend we also have rules to sanitize user's input, **but considering in the future we might want this API to work without the frontend so sanitizing here is also needed.** I reported the situation to the manager and let him know the issue, then told him I'm not able to deliver it by today. He said he understood the situation, no worries, just go for it. The next day, I added some rules in all of the APIs inside of that function and fully tested them before I committed the code. He thought I did a pretty good job on that.

## Customer didn’t require but like it / beyond expectation
That was a project designed for local researchers, they used to use excel to record data in a long time and do the calculations all manually. Then since the metrics they're tracking is continues growing so they reach out to my professor hope we can design a system to help them to simplify their job, then my professor reachout to me and another classmate to see if we are interested on that, and we formed a team to do that. The main functions is to do CRUD for their data, and we also need to allowing them import their old data to the new system from their excel files. We also need to do statistics for them and generate various of results and Charts, so they can see the number or other metrics of bacteria or something is changing or not. Or the trend of them. We actually found they have lots of different sampling point, and the location data are all in latitude and longitude, it's hard to understand where the sampling point exactly is by just looking at this data, I think they definitely need to translate that to a point to something more human readable so we pluged in a third party map API, and we display all of the sampling point as a pin on that map, Once you Click on that pin, it will display the detailed data that sampling point collected and some button to view the Statistic data and charts calculated for that point. Our clients really love this feature and it's a suprise since they didn't except to have this. We are very happy to see they love it as well.

## News sort speed in Cmind
It was my latest internship. I was in charge of a new feature named portfolio, which allows the user to save their target company into a portfolio(favorites) list for easier browsing in the future. In this portfolio, we will show detailed information according to the companies the user added, such as recent news. The data team will grab the recent news for us and store them in to database, For the recent news feature, it would display 5 recent news for each company immediately, but there is a problem that the speed of fetching news is too slow, and the more companies there are, the slower the speed, sometimes it always consumes 7 sec.

My manager asked me to optimize the performance of news fetching in 3 days, cuz next week he wants to demo our website to a potential customer. 

Time is running out because all the news data was stored in the MongoDB, and the fetching function was implemented by my predecessor intern, he just fetched all the target data from DB and did the clean, filter, and sort function in the frontend, that consumes too much performance, so at the first, I decided to implement the clean and sort procedure in the MongoDB by overwriting the NoSQL query, so when the data is retrieved, it is the prepared data. Actually, the performance had been boosted and the time had been reduced to five seconds, but it was still not satisfactory. I reported the situation to my manager and he thought that was enough. I persuaded him that there was still one day left, so I could try to solve this. 

After researching many references online, I noticed that it already reached the limitation of mongoDB’s s performance cuz we had eighty thousand dataset. At the same time, I remembered that another team was working on the searching function for another feature, they utilized Elasticsearch for high-efficiency search, and they backed up the news data as well, which means that I could utilize ElasticSearch to optimize performance. I started to self-learn the ElasticSearch official document, try to implement it on the backend, and created RESTful API for the frontend, after fully testing, the current fetching speed became 1.5s, my manager was surprised and he told me that I did a pretty good job.
## NEU Project arrangement

**Situation**: When I was in my first semester in Northeastern University, I took a course named Application Engineering and Development which used Java to develop full-stack project.

**Task**: And the first project of this course was to develop an airline reservation system. I had two teammates in this project. But situation at that time is that we all didn’t any experience in developing project using Java, and both of them even didn’t learn any programming languages before. I was the only one who had programming experience in the team. So it was really hard for us to get started on the project. So I came up with an idea that I could take the lead of the project and try to finish the main class design, and they can focus on the easier part like UI design and some functions by using the API I finish. I was so confident that I could finish it myself within one week since I believed I have good understanding on programming language, and I am a fast learner. And they also trust me and then I start. And they just waited for me to complete the classes and then they could continue working on their part. **During** the time working on my part, I hardly discussed with them about the system requirements, and I just finished the class design by myself. And for some part that should be more complicated, like choosing seats, I just did it in a really simple way like adding a textbox for customer to type in and didn’t consider about the edge case like seats not available since I was afraid I wasn’t able to accomplish that. And I didn’t tell my teammates about that. After I finished my code, my teammates started working on their part. They had a lot of questions on my code. They couldn’t understand so many logics between the classes since they had fewer experience on coding, and they didn’t know what I was thinking since I hardly communicate with them. And they also have many disagreements on my design, and I didn’t meet their requirements. 

**Action**: I realized I made a big mistake at work. I didn’t meet their requirements and since they just had fewer experience I left them behind and never asked them for suggestions. So I set up a meeting with them to further discuss what they were thinking and what system requirements I missed. And I spent 2 days going through the code I finished and made sure them understand the logic. And I also created a Google doc to add classes and gave an explanation on each of the class and shared with them. And whenever we added something we will also keep the Google doc updated so that each of us can understand other’s work. 

**Result**: We finished our project in time and we all improved a lot in Java programming and teamwork. And after this experience, whenever I work with others, I will take my ownership and always be ready to help others. Also, I will always ask others’ thoughts and take their requirements into consideration. I noticed that ownership and customer obsession and earn trust are the critical leadership principals of Amazon and I will always stick to it.


## Data Science course import package
It happened when I was learning the Data Science course at Northeastern, I didn't have any ds foundation before I took this Class, and I chose to take it because of my personal interest. I think I have to try it first, then I'll find out if it's interesting for me or not. I didn't do well in the first few months, it has lots of math concepts as a foundation, and I'm not pretty good at it. In the midterm, I encountered some technical issues. One of my import packages continuously goes wrong. I tried to ask the professor for help but it took nearly 15 mins to fix. Professor said it's my responsibility to make sure it's running before the exam, and I'm glad to take the negative feedback, and I didn't get a great score in midterm, both because the question is challenging and the tech issue. I work very hard after midterm, especially in the area that I'm not geed at, Study with classmates to discuss those question I don't really understand l spend lots of time on my final project, it's Pretty successful and my professor said that topie is really interesting, that inspired me a lot. My efforts paid off, I did well in the final exam as well. Eventually I got an A on that course

## Lots of deadlines
That was my first semester since studying at Northeastern, that’s also the first time I step on the land of the US. Everything is new, and I have some learning curve.

I enrolled 2 classes in that semester (Application Engineering Development, and web design), at the final, I have bunch of deadlines, from exam, project, and the online assignment from some online courses on Coursera.

It is really challenging for me to study so many things in a different language environment, I have to manage well, I tried to use some time management tools like calendar and reminder to help me arrange tasks, by the way, they definitely helped me a lot, especially when you face several deadlines and feel confused or disorganized. So firstly, I list all the deadlines and exam dates in the reminder, then I prioritized them according to their important level, for example, AED was the required subject and pre course of some courses I wanna take in the next semester, it is the most important so I just set AED as the highest priority, for the Web design, because its due date was later than AED, and the project is relatively simple, so its priority is not too high. As for the online course, I noticed that there was an option to extend the deadline, so I would have more flexible time to pay attention on my campus project. Then I just arrange those tasks on my calendar so that they could notified me before the task start.

Besides that, I also sacrificed a lot of personal time to review those classes for a few hours, then change to another class, to adjust myself. I made my notes more concise to make sure I focus on the most important part.

The power of a single person is weak. I usually study with my classmates, they can often answer my questions, and when I am answering their questions, I get more familiar with this.

After meeting all of the deadlines, I am pretty happy with that cuz I know I already tried my best.

From this process, I found when I have too many tasks on my plate, I will feel stressful, but I usually spend a few minutes to outline a schedule, I found it's really important to take a step back and identify which task is priority, then use notes to remind me of the tasks I have to accomplish every day. And I think communicating well with other people in terms of timing is also a key to stay focused. 

## Most frequently searched keywords
It was my latest internship in the Cmind, at that time, I was in charge of the searching feature,  which allows the user to input the company’s name or ticker or CIK, and we will display the corresponding info for the user, such as the C-score(one score that computed by us with machine learning algorithms), recently news, news mention times change, and anything else.

Actually there was still a little problem with this page, not about the function, but design. because this page is a little bit tedious, there was only a search bar and search button placed in the center of the page, the rest of the page was just empty and blank. From the User Experience perspective, it is not a good design. Try to imagine a scenario that if there is a new user of our product, he / she probably feels confused about this page and doesn't know how to use it. At that time, it suddenly occurred to me that in the former infrastructure design part, our tech lead already let us record user behavior and search habits in the database, so can I do some work in this area? So, I just came up with an idea which is to set the recent trending keywords below the search bar. It also could be a reference for the user when he / she doesn’t have any search target.

After communicating with our UX designer and receiving positive feedback, I started to work on it. As our tech lead already let us record some user searching habits, so it is not hard for me to retrieve those data, then I  and I did a clean and statistics operation, then sorted them. Finally, I obtained the 10 most frequently searched keywords and dynamically displayed them below the search bar. 

My manager told me that he liked this part very much, and our client was surprised since he didn’t expect to have this. We are very happy to see he loves it as well.


## Help intern debug (date sort problem)
Sure thing, during my working and learning process, I always love to help my classmates or colleagues because you must want to be helped when you are in trouble as well right? I remembered when I was in my internship, another intern just reached out to me for some problems, cuz he was new here just for 1 week. He is a little bit timid and he really doesn’t know how to get things working. You know, working at a startup company, everyone is busy here and probably some of the experienced colleagues are part-time. You can definitely reach out to your colleagues for help but you don’t really know how fast they will reply.

` `He told me that he had been troubled for a long time on the data format, and asked for help from me. I had exactly some experience when I joined, I totally understood the situation he had, so I gave him a hand.

` `The thing is he was working on a table that will show the different info about each company in each row. Like the market value, stock price, and so on. So as we know, there should be a sort function for better user experience. Like sorting stock prices from low to high, or sorting by the date…….., but he always encountered a situation where sorting by date didn’t work.

I did a screen sharing with him to fix this bug, since the date about those companies was retrieved from our database, I just checked the original data without cleaning and filtering in the database. I found that some of the earlier date was stored as String format, that was definitely a big mistake!, otherwise u need to convert the String into a timestamp. So for the data, I just let him restore those data as date format, for the frontend, I just helped him write a temporary function for format converting. Once the data has been updated, there was no need to use that tmp function. An hour later, it runs as expected.

After that, we often discuss the bugs we met or the solutions to new feature, he also shared lots of decent ideas that helps me a lot.

so I do believe help others is a win-win



## Design complicated Email notification function

**S:**

**Cmind做notification，简述需求，提出冲突（mng要做one page design，但是我认为有潜在问题）**

That was my last internship in Cmind Ai, I was required to implement a notification setting  panel for a portfolio. For this setting panel, it allowed the users to track the data changes about the target companies user saved in their portfolio and get notification in time. For each company, there were 4 checkboxes, corresponding to 4 types of data needed to track. After meeting with the manager, he provided me with a design plan for this part. I was required to implement all the functions in one single page, however I thought that there were potential problems about one page design, so I didn't agree with his approach. 

**T:**

**我想做two page design，具体功能是什么，任务是调查两种哪种好，然后和mng达成共识**

From my perspective, I think we should have a two page design, for the first page, the user  only needs to consider which company they want to get notification from, for the second page, they can check the data type and change the value they want to be notified. Due to the limited deadline, the task I need to deal with is to research which of the two designs is more suitable for needs, and reach a consensus with the manager ASAP.

**A:**

**建对比列表，在figma实现demo，反复尝试，发现one page design公司多的话，很乱，跟mng开会说清楚**

Then I created a list for those 2 designs and made a comparison. Then I used Figma (a UX design tool) to implement those 2 demos and tried several times under different situations. During this process, I found that compared with 2 page design, even though 1 page design looks very concise and simple, it seems that all the information is on one page, which is more intuitive, but if the user saved more than 10 companies in this portfolio, and there would be 10 \* 4 = 40 checkboxes squeeze on one page, and it is very unclear and confused, and the user experience is not very good. But if we use 2 page design, the users only need to follow the flows we set for each page, and they only need to consider their needs based on the current page, that is more logical and efficient. I have summarized a document about my research result. Then I set up a brief meeting with my manager and took him to go through the 2 different demos, and told him whyI think the 2 page design is better than 1 page design.

**R:**

**达成共识**

After viewing my demo and summary, he understood me and trusted my approach was correct and we reached a consensus. He modified the design plan and I completed the work before the deadline and it proved to work well. After this conflict, I learned that communication is the best way to resolve the confilcts.

## Cmind news trending 太多lines在chart里，客户不喜欢

4 lines 可以提一下 为什么4条线是最好的

Situation:

The biggest mistake / fail I've made happened when I worked as an intern in Cmind. I got a requirement from a client about adding a new feature(news Trending visualization, which is to allow the user to search a keyword under the target company, then the News change related to this keyword and company will be displayed in the chart and at the same time, it will also show the news trending of the target company's competitors. ). So I documented requirements, worked with the data team, and released the update to the demo system on time. However, the client tried the new feature and didn't like it.

Task:

I diagnosed the feedback immediately. It turned out that I paid more attention to the details that the client requested us to add. There were too many colors and lines in the line chart, there were about at most 7 lines, which made the chart look dense, which would make users confused and hard to find the data they need.

Action:

I emailed the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended delivery date. Fortunately, the client showed understanding and agreed. Then I set up a meeting with the manager and my teammates, talked about the feedback and evaluated all possible interactions that users might take on the control panel and then documented the changes we were going to make. After discussion and evaluation, we decided to limit the control panel to only enable 3 most competitors as the default view, corresponding to 3 colors. We also provided users with options like they could customize the competitors they want to display. Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened and why the client was not happy. We brought up a lot of good options to build better user experience on the new feature. So instead of just telling the team to make changes directly, I earned other team members' trust by sharing client's feedback and working out the solution together.

Result:

Then we released an updated version to the demo system before the deadline, walked it through with the client and received good feedback. From this mistake, I learnt that I need to look at a problem from a global perspective, focusing on the details is not wrong, but it may lead to other problems. Only by considering all aspects and maintaining good communication with other teammates can we better meet the needs of customers and win the trust of teammates at the same time.
## Conflict with teammate
**S:**

Well, I have an interesting story to share. It happened when I worked for Cmind AI, which is a start-up fin-tech company. My manager asked me and one of my teammates to implement a new feature, in order to ensure that we are at the same progress and for better communication and learning, we decided to review each other’s code every two days. However I found out that he had some bad coding habits, which will cause confusions, even mistakes in the future developing task. He wrote all the code into one class, that class is super long, and each function is pretty long as well, therefore, I found there were lots of duplicated codes, just the variables passed in are different. For each function, he didn't even give any comments to those codes.

**T:**

So I just messaged him from the working channel. I told him that your code is working but it is too long, too complex. It’s not readable for anyone but you. I think It’s better to separate those codes into different classes, and extract major code segments which used more than one time and encapsulate them into independent reusable functions. He replied to me that he thought it was not a big problem because he thought we are not going to change those codes for a long period, as long as they are working, it should be fine.

**A:**

Actually he is just a Sophomore student and doesn’t have any experience in practice and working. As we know, there was definitely a huge difference between work and study, so it is pretty understandable that sometimes students like him don’t know the importance of decouple, because of lack of practical experience. Then I just set up a quick meeting with him, explained the importance of scalability, and made some examples to merge those duplicate codes into one reusable function and call them directly when needed. As for the comments, I told him that although comments don't seem to help running the code directly, and it takes time to write, but it could remind you and other colleagues of the major meaning of this code in a short time. Even it will be more helpful in future iterations and handovers. That is why This time spent is worth it.

**R:**

After the meeting, He is willing to take my advice. By refacting those codes, it gets easier to locate the functions, and it helps to reduce the redundant workload. The code review between us has also become smoother, and the progress of the entire project has become faster than before.

## Figma for personal Project AwesomeRushB


**S:**

That was my group project AwesomeRushB, which is a full-stack project with an Agile development method, Yeah we just wanna have a try to follow this standard development flow. and for me, I joined this team later and I was in charge of the front end part. Before that, they just started to conceive the whole project and design a simple UI.

**T:** 

**以前使用google doc做简单流程图，手动画UI，太费时间，效率不高。我想把课上学过的Figma介绍给大家。**

Due to the lack of the UI design member, and none of the other team members have corresponding UI design experience, there were not some standardized workflows and professional working tools. Before this time, they two just used google doc to generate some basic and simple flowcharts to demonstrate the major function of the current UI, for some more complex functions and interfaces, we just draw it manually in the google doc, yup, literally draw it. That would be time-consuming and ineffective, and because it was drawn manually, it lacks design standards. So even though the UI came out, I might still be confused about the component’s precise location, UI’s unified theme color, and so on. I think this is not professional, and we need a more standard way. So I want to introduce Figma (which is a design tool that I learned in UI & UX design course) to my teammates. This can not only reduce the design time but also ensure the stability and accuracy of those components.

**A:**

**创建使用文档，介绍优点，可以多人协作，然后快速实现了需求，开会展示，大家都很喜欢**

So at first, I just created a setup document about how to use it for my team. In this document, I not only introduced how to set up this application but also compared the new method with the previous one. And I demonstrated what the advantages of this software are, why this application could save time, and why we need a more professional tool. More importantly, this application can collaborate online with multiple people, which is more conducive to teamwork and will not miss any inspiration and ideas. Then next,  I just created a project in Figma, quickly implemented a demo UI for the login page, and added the reasonable jump logic with the easy-to-implement animation effects. I had a meeting with other teammates, showed them the demo, went through the document, and explained that the design tasks could be completed more efficiently and standardly. they agreed with me and let me quickly train them how to use it.

**R:**

Since we can collaborate online, we can quickly understand each other's ideas. Finally, we quickly completed the UI design work, and as for me, cuz I was responsible for the front-end part, I was able to write CSS code very accurately that reducing some unnecessary questions. 
## Use New York Times API to get more training data (news heading)
// 改进，重点说怎么面对tight deadline的，比如意识到还有三天，先是规划了一下时间，用晚上的私人时间学习web crawler和api相关的知识，然后简单测试，第二天一天编写fetching代码，并且处理，清洗，剩下的一天把数据丢到模型里面训练

**S:**

That was my data science course project, our target was trying to use news headlines to predict the stock price’ change. As we know, in some general situation, the more data sets, the more accurate the training results, but the current thing is, we need to prepare a huge volume of the data by ourselves and complete this project in one week.

**T:**

We Started to search related references online, tried to download some open-source news dataset. however, the data sets that can be downloaded on the Internet are very limited, and there are the following problems. The amount of data is too small, the data is too old, and there are a lot of garbled codes, which need to be cleaned up manually. Seeing that time flies, we haven’t made any progress, so we had to train our model with a super old 500M data set first. Just to make sure that our logic is on the right track and model could work. In fact, our model works perfectly, but because the amount of data is too small, the results are not desirable. Actually, I think I am the person who always want to do the best and always stick to high standards, so in order to get better results, I tried to find another way to get the target data sets. Even though there was not much time left.

**A:**

After browsing on the Internet, I found out that The New York Times officially provides developer an API, which could grab nearly 30 years of news data. But I have never used it, not sure if it could meet the demands, as the time flies, So I decided to sacrifice my personal time to self-learn some basic web crawler knowledge and try this approach. I registered an account on The New York Times developer platform and applied a token for API. It turned out that I have to send a request via API and token and waiting for the result sending back. In order to ensure we could get the better training result; I grab nearly 30 years news info. As the data was quite raw, we could not use them directly for our model and there were some details that I didn’t require, so after fetching, I did series of data cleaning job to make sure they fit our model, after my approaching, finally, we got nearly 2 gigabyte of pure text data, which is quite a lot and that is definitely enough for our model training.

**R:**

We completed the training before deadline, during the final presentation, we introduced how we obtain the news data, and made a comparison that result from large volume datasets was more ideal and precise! The professor agreed with our approach and told us that we did a pretty good job! From this experience, I learnt that as long as there is time left, never give up any possible opportunities, and When faced with complex problems, we should not lowered standards.




In order to train our model, we definitely need a large volume of data. **So we grab nearly 30 years of news data from New York times API**, considering the volume is huge, and we can get pretty much information just From the news headline, we choose to use this 30 years of news headline to be our data source and it's nearly one gigabyte of pure text data, which is a lot.




## Learn react for the internship
S:

When I worked as an intern in Cmind Ai.  My main job there is to develop the front-end part with ReactJS.  I have some experience on the Angular framework before cuz I learnt it from my course and used Angular to do some projects on the campus, but I have never used React before. I only have a week to learn this new technology, and then I will start to take over projects quickly.

T:

So I clarified my learning task: First of all, I want to review the basic conditions required by the React framework: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Learn the execution environment of React: Node.JS and the editor VS Studio. Then you have to learn the basic concepts and component structure in ReactJs. Finally, try to build a simple React App.

A:

First I review the basics. Every front-end developer starts their journey with three things: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is the skeleton of a website and defines the structure of each component. CSS defines the style of each component, such as color, height, and width. JavaScript defines functions, what each part does (const, let, arrow function).For the environment, Node.js is the execution environment of JavaScript. I can manage packages through npm, and then use import and export to control modules. For the editor, VS studio is a good code compiler, it has a good interface, easy to add various plug-ins and is suitable for multiple languages. After reviewing the basics, I started to learn ReactJS following the official document. ReactJS is a JS library that can use reusable components to build front-end apps. There is a parent-child structure relationship between components, state can be used to control state within components, and props can be used to transfer parameters between components. The style of React is also controlled by CSS. After understanding the basics of React, I started to build a simple page based on the tutorial, including a menu bar, title, and different cards. (Create react app, build components, combine together, edit css, router to jump to detail page).

R:

After a week of learning, I can basically use react to build a website. So, I had a meeting with the UX team. to determine the basic style of the website, and implemented the project structure and welcome onboarding interface before the first review.

## Web Tools project’s searching feature should have a autocomplete function
**S:**

During my third semester, I was taking the Web tools & development course, for the final project, I chose the area I am most interested in, that was a web application allow user to browse and appreciate art online. After two weeks of continuous working on it, I completed this project before deadline. In order to ensure that everything will work well in the final presentation, I participated in the TA hours and tried to demo my project to get some advices. However, after viewing my demo, TA told me that there was a problem with my project, which might cause bad user experience.

**T:**

The TA just gave me negative feedback, he pointed out that even if my website was working, but I need to make some improvements to the search function to refine the user experience. Currently, the searching function is quite simple, it just allowed the user to type their keywords and press search button, then just wait for the searching results. However, nowadays, there was a user-friendly function for many websites’ searching feature, which is autocomplete search or searching suggestions. Especially for my website, searching function is still more important part.

After meeting with TA, I was willing to accept the TA’s feedback.

**A:**

In order to figure out the principle of autocomplete function, I started to search for relevant references online. I learnt that this could be implemented with AJAX, which allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. So that’s why when the user types a keyword, the autocompleting content of the search box will change dynamically. Then I tried to implement a simple AJAX code according to the guidance of the JQuery’s documentation. For the autocompleting content, I just use the backend API that I already developed to get the candidates keywords, then match them with the target keyword using fuzzy strategy. 

**R:**

With those approaches, I almost done the autocompleting searching function, after trying several tests and adjusting the CSS code, it proved to work well, during this process, I also made a lot of progresses on the Front-end part. Even after I learned, now Fetch has replaced JQuery’s $.ajax,  the method I tried is no longer recommended. But I think this is a very good learning path, and lays a foundation for me to better master Fetch method, my efforts got paid off and From this process I learned that I should not be afraid of failures, whereas I should improve myself to satisfy customers to deliver results. 

## AwesomeRushB Author Editor develop
**S:**

This Spring, I was working on my personal project: AwesomeRushB, which is a web application that allow users share the articles about Data structure and Algorithms. I was mainly in charge of the front-end part. Because I joined our team later, so I got my first task is to develop an online editor for the users.

**T:**

Actually, the problem I was encountering is the ambiguous requirement, my other teammates have no experience of using React, so they didn’t know the specific development strategy, like how to implement an online editor, how to achieve the real-time rendering effects, and which of the editors should we use? For example, there were many different types of online editors, like Rich Text Editor, Markdown Editor, and so on. So, the task I need to deal with is figure out the specific developing direction. Not just implement an online editor.

**A:**

So, I just set up a meeting with my teammates to discuss the development direction, Firstly, we just analyzed the user needs. The main user group of our website is programmer, so for them, they were more like to use markdown to edit document, that’s the user habits. On the other hand, since it is a website that sharing algorithm and data structure, so the author will definitely insert some code blocks in the article to help understand, so Markdown has better support for code blocks, and its syntax is simple, so we decided to use the Markdown Editor. In addition, they originally want me to implement an editor from the beginning / zero. I said that there are many open sourced, perfect, easy-to-installed markdown editor on the Internet. Because we lack relevant practical experience, we may have some unexpected bugs if we develop by ourselves. So, for us, it is better to stand on the giant’s shoulder, which means just use online libraries. Moreover, many online libraries also support real-time rendering and reverse rendering, which means when we take the article out of the database, we can use this library to render into formatted html webpages, that definitely saved us a lot of time. After our discussion, we decided to use a library with a high degree of customization.

**R:**

The library worked pretty well, the style of the editor matches our web page design, at the same time, on the right side, the user can see the results of real-time rendering, which is a great help for editing articles. During this, it improves our development efficiency, and allow us to pay more attention on other functions.
